# Obsidian-Edge

Obsidian Edge is a student project focused on exploring Graphical Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using C/C++. The project involves hands-on experience with graphics rendering, shader programming, and user interface design. In addition to technical skills, we are applying Agile project management methodologies to enhance collaboration and adaptability within our team. This initiative allows us to strengthen our programming abilities while gaining valuable insights into effective project organization and teamwork.
